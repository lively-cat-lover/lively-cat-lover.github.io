Abstract. Gallagher's theorem describes the multiplicative diophantine 
approximation rate of a typical vector. We establish a fully-inhomogeneous 
version of Gallagher's theorem, a diophantine fibre refinement, and a 
sharp and unexpected threshold for Liouville fibres. Along the way, we 
prove an inhomogeneous version of the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture for a 
class of non-monotonic approximation functions. Joint with Niclas Technau.
