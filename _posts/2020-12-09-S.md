Abstract: Consider the set of points in a homogeneous space $G/\Gamma$
whose $g_t$-orbit misses a fixed open set. It has measure zero
if the flow is ergodic. It has been conjectured that this set has
Hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than the dimension of whole space. This
conjecture is proved when $G/\Gamma$ is compact or when has real rank. In
this talk we will prove the conjecture for probably the most important
example of the higher rank case namely: $\mathrm{SL}(m+n, \mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}(m+n, \mathbb{Z})$ and $g_t = \mathrm{diag}\{e^{t/m}, \dots , e^{t/m}, e^{-t/n}, \dots, e^{-t/n}\}$. This
homogeneous space has many applications in Diophantine
approximation that will be discussed in the talk if time permits. This
project is joint work with Dmitry Kleinbock.
