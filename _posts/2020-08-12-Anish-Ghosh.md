Abstract: I will discuss new results on the `shrinking target problem'  including a logarithm law for approximation by geodesics in negatively curved manifolds and Hausdorff dimension estimates for finer spiraling phenomena of geodesics. I will also discuss the large intersection property of Falconer in the context of negative curvature and some applications to Diophantine approximation and to hyperbolic geometry. This is joint work with Debanjan Nandi.
