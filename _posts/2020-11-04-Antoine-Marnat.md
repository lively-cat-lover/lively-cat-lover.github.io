Abstract: It is well known that in dimension one, the set of Dirichlet 
improvable real numbers consists precisely of badly approximable and 
singular numbers. We show that in higher dimensions this disjoint union 
is not the full set of Dirichlet improvable vectors: we prove that there 
exist uncountably many Dirichlet improvable vectors that are neither 
badly approximable nor singular. We construct these numbers using the 
parametric geometry of numbers. Furthermore, by doing so we can choose 
the exponent of Diophantine approximation by a rational subspace of 
dimension exactly $d$, for any d between $0$ and $n-1$.
