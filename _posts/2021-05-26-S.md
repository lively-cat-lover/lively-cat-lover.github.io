Abstract: While the abc Conjecture remains open, much work has been done on weaker versions, and on generalising the conjecture to number fields. Stewart and Yu were able to give an exponential bound for $\max\{a, b, c\}$ in terms of the radical over the integers, while Györy was able to give an exponential bound for the projective height $H(a, b, c)$ in terms of the radical for algebraic integers. We generalise Stewart and Yu's method to give an improvement on Györy's bound for algebraic integers.
