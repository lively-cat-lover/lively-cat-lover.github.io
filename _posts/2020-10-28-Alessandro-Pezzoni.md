Abstract: Simultaneous Diophantine approximation on manifolds is notoriously
complicated, since it requires to take into account the arithmetic
properties of a manifold, as well as the analytic ones. In this talk
we will make some progress towards a metric theory of approximation on
manifolds by algebraic numbers with algebraic conjugate coordinates,
generalising a conjecture of Sprind≈æuk's.
