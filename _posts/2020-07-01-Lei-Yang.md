Abstract: We will prove that badly approximable points (no matter weighted or unweighted) on any analytic non-degenerate curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an absolute winning set. This confirms a key conjecture in the area stated by Badziahin and Velani (2014) which represents a far-reaching generalisation of Davenport's problem from the 1960s. Amongst various consequences of our main result is a solution to Bugeaud's problem on real numbers badly approximable by algebraic numbers of arbitrary degree. This work is joint with Victor Beresnevich and Erez Nesharim.
