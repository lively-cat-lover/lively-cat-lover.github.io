 Abstract: Hillel Furstenberg conjectured in the 1960s that the intersections of closed $\times 2$ and $\times 3$-invariant Cantor sets have "small" Hausdorff dimension. This conjecture was proved independently by Meng Wu and by myself; recently, Tim Austin found a simple proof. I will present some generalizations of the intersection conjecture and other related results.
