Abstract: We obtain new upper bounds on the minimal density of lattice coverings of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by dilates of a convex body $K$. We also obtain bounds on the probability (with respect to the natural Haar-Siegel measure on the space of lattices) that a randomly chosen lattice $L$ satisfies $L+K=\mathbb{R}^n$. Joint work with Or Ordentlich and Oded Regev.
