Abstract: In the talk we consider the spatial distribution of points that have algebraic (Galois) 
conjugate coordinates of fixed degree and bounded height. We give an asymptotic formula for 
counting such points in a wide class of regions of Euclidean space (as the parameter that bounds 
heights grows to infinity). We explain connection of this formula to random polynomials 
with i.i.d. coefficients. We also discuss some corollaries and applications of the formula. 
The talk is based on a joint work with F. GÃ¶tze and D. Zaporozhets.
